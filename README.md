Segmentation and prediction of numbers

An assignment I had to do for a computer vision course. The pictures are from [Dr. Alessandro Giusti](https://github.com/alessandro-giusti).

The task was to extract numbers from photographed sheets of paper. The numbers and the papers could have any orientation. Sometimes only a part of the paper is visible.

Old fashioned Image Processing techniques extract individual numbers. Those are then processed with a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
